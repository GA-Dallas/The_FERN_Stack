## What is Google Firebase?

_Founded by James Tamplin and Andrew Lee as “Firebase” in 2011, then acquired by Google in 2014._

_“Firebase frees developers, so they can focus on creating phenomenal user experiences. You don’t need to manage servers, write an API, or configure a datastore.”_

_“Firebase is your server, your API and your datastore."_

#### Who Uses Google Firebase?

Ever since Google acquired firebase in 2014, it's rise in popularity has skyrocked to where it is today. Google Firebase gets better each year with robust features for both web and mobile applications.

Many developers and companies have found tremendous value in this technology, which is why you probably recognize all of these brands!

#### Not Just A Database

This is where many people get confused when they hear of Google Firebase for the first time. Although the Real Time Database is a core feature, it's just one of several services you can use from Google Firebase:

**The Best Definition of Google Firebase is that it's a "BAAS" (Backend As A Service)**

#### The Google Firebase Real Time Database (RTDB)
- The Core Service That Put the Spotlight on Firebase
- A Single JSON Object that allows up to 32 levels of Depth (We don't recommend nesting your data that deep though)

## Setup Our React Frontend

It's time to make sparks fly! Assuming you have the `create-react-app` build tool installed. Navigate to your Desktop `cd ~/Desktop` and then run `create-react-app react-fire-todos` to build our react application and install base dependencies.
